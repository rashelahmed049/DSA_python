Practicing DSA with Python
I'm trying to cover all the DSA's algorithm using Python. Focus is mostly on graph and sorting!. 
Once all the algo are covered,using these algo's will try to build real life app program(games, platform,etc...)
Feel free to use my contribution. Anyone can comment and modify the code with better approach..

Thank you!!!
